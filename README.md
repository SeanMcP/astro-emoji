üöÄ An accessible Emoji component for Astro applications

## Why?

Emojis can add a light playfulness to your project but require some specific formatting in order to ensure they are accessible for all users. `astro-emoji`'s reusable `Emoji` component helps you do that quickly and painlessly.

## Installation

Add `astro-emoji` to your project:

```sh
npm install astro-emoji
# or
yarn add astro-emoji
```

## Use

Import the default `Emoji` from `astro-emoji` and add it to your code:

```astro
---
import Emoji from 'astro-emoji';
---

<footer>
    Made with
    {' '}
    <Emoji symbol="üíï" label="love" />
    {' '}
    by Sean McPherson
</footer>
```

The resulting markup for that component signature will be:

```html
<span aria-label="love" role="img">üíï</span>
```

`Emoji`s with no `label` prop are rendered with `aria-hidden="true"`:

```astro
<Emoji symbol="ü§ê" />
<!-- Renders -->
<span aria-hidden="true" role="img">ü§ê</span>
```

## Emoji component

The `Emoji` component consumes two props: `symbol` and `label`. Every other prop is spread to the top-level `<span>` element.

### Forbidden properties

The following properties are managed internally, and therefore ignored if passes as props to `Emoji`:

- `aria-hidden`
- `aria-label`
- `role`

The main benefit of using `astro-emoji` is that you don't need to worry about setting these HTML attributes correctly yourself.
